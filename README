Sales Taxes - Ruby and RSpec
Design:
  I created three entities for this application(basket, item and receipt).

Assumptions:
  1. All input files would be added to the input_files directory with a .txt extension
  2. The input data would follow the follow format(quantity, name, price)

Instructions: 
  Ruby version: ruby 2.0.0p247
  RSpec version: 2.14.4

  1. From the root directory run: ruby sales_tax.rb
  2. Input files are located in the input_files directory
  3. Assuming that RSpec is installed run specs with: rspec spec/
